🧠 What is Ghiblify?

Ghiblify is a AI experience that transforms your real-world images into whimsical, dreamlike Ghibli-style artwork — all while protecting your privacy and empowering artists.

This is not just another AI image filter. Ghiblify runs on Federated Learning powered by Blockchain, ensuring that:
	•	Your data stays yours
	•	Artists are credited and incentivized
	•	Every transformation contributes to a better, decentralized AI model

🌍 Why Ghiblify?

Ghiblify is different. It’s built on SoraChain AI, a decentralized infrastructure for training AI collaboratively and transparently. Ghiblify is our flagship proof of concept.

It shows how:
	•	Artists can retain ownership of their styles
	•	Users can convert personal photos without data leaving their device
	•	Communities can train AI models together and get rewarded

🛠️ How It Works
	1.	User Uploads Image
	•	Image stays local or is temporarily processed in a privacy-preserving way
	2.	Model Transformation
	•	AI model converts your photo into a Ghibli-style painting
	3.	Federated Learning
	•	If opted-in, anonymized training data improves the model across all users
	4.	Blockchain Layer
